            "beside her, not to better her sight, but to see what he would look like bathed\n",
            "in gold instead of silver. Why was he coming toward her? Closer and closer\n",

            "where there isn’t one, Jin said in her head. And she was. It was why she’d\n",

            "“Sit down,” she said.\n",
            "She had saved his life, and he had saved hers.\n",

            "Laith brewed himself a cup of coffee, and Arthie shook her head when he\n",
            "offered her some. She didn’t care for its bitterness. It had none of the\n",
            "comfort of tea. He shrugged and stirred in five sugar cubes. At that point, he\n",

            "shifted, the silver shimmering, the black beckoning. She heard the catch in\n",
            "his breath as Calibore the knife became Calibore the hairpin, pretty enough\n",
            "for her hair, sharp enough to kill. It became a pair of scissors, a bladed star,\n",

            "“How?” he asked as he sat down on the rug, coffee mug in hand.\n",
            "The first time it had happened, Arthie had been on the run with Jin. She\n",
            "remembered him joking about needing a quieter weapon than a pistol.\n",
            "Arthie wished for it too, and seconds later dropped the sword between\n",
            "them. They each stared down at the thing as if they’d been duped by the\n",
            "other. Neither of them had known how it happened.\n",
            "If anyone were to open up the pistol and look inside, there would be a\n",
            "single bullet in its chamber, despite the fact that she had used it and never\n",

            "kill anything too.\n",
            "Even vampires.\n",
            "Arthie had learned that the hard way when she’d stumbled on Reni,\n",
            "young and orphaned and under attack in a derelict alley, screaming for help.\n",
            "Arthie had shot at the vampire hoping to buy time for a getaway, but she’d\n",
            "gotten more than that. Reni had been too traumatized from being turned into\n",
            "a vampire to remember the incident, but he remained with them after that,\n",
            "and Calibore had never left her side.\n",
            "Over the years, Arthie had cared for Calibore in a way no one really\n",
            "cared for a pistol. It made her stronger, not in the way a weapon typically\n",
            "did, but because it was proof she’d outsmarted an empire. In that way of\n",
            "his, Jin claimed that perhaps, because of how Arthie appreciated it, the\n",
            "pistol had begun to fancy her back. Enough that it would shape itself into\n",
            "whatever weapon she needed. She’d never told a soul aside from Jin.\n",
            "Until now.\n",
            "“Don’t concern yourself with how it worked as much as the fact that it\n",
            "did,” she answered.\n",
            "Of everything Arthie expected of him, she did not think he would look\n",
            "away, eyelashes sweeping downward like knives relinquished.\n",
            "“Thank you,” he said finally. “For saving me.”\n",
            "This time, she looked away. She hadn’t expected him to forgo his pride\n",
            "and thank her, and she certainly hadn’t expected him to sound so earnest.\n",
            "She bit down on her tongue until the pain made her angry. That was the\n",
            "state she had lived in for the past decade, and that was what kept her\n",
            "moving forward. But since meeting Laith, it felt as if she’d lost control of\n",
            "herself. Something was forcing her to suffer one emotion after the next—\n",
            "exasperation, confusion, distress, and now this: guilt.\n",
            "“You ought—”\n",
            "“What you said to the man at the warehouse,” he interjected. His kitten\n",
            "crawled into his lap, purring louder than a motor. “When he spoke of your\n",
            "mother.”\n",
            "“Funny that was what you focused on.” Arthie didn’t want to talk about\n",
            "her mother, not here and now in the dead of the night when memories\n",
            "crawled out of their graves.\n",
            "“Have you no family?”\n",
            "Her pocket watch thrummed against her stomach. “Jin is my family.\n",

            "dedicated we are to getting that ledger.”\n",
            "Disappointment flickered in his eyes, and something about the gesture\n",
            "gave her pause.\n",
            "“I watched my mother and father die,” she said, softer this time.\n",
            "Perhaps it was the night that made it easier to unwrap truths. “I had no one\n",
            "else.”\n",
            "That last sentence was a lie. Between her parents and Jin, there had\n",
            "been someone else, hadn’t there? Someone who had cared and taken her in\n",
            "and called her his own. Until she’d run away.\n",
            "Did Laith know? When he had voiced the name for a second time in\n",
            "Matteo’s house, had he known its significance?\n",
            "The clouds drifted in front of the moon, rearranging him into\n",
            "something darker, less good. She waited, knowing he wouldn’t draw\n",
            "information out of her without an even exchange. She might not have\n",
            "known him long, but somehow, she knew this. It was his turn.\n",
            "“I’ve never liked thrones and those who sit on them, digging graves\n",
            "with a swipe of a pen.” He spoke the words with a quiet vitriol, reminding\n",
            "her that she knew very little about him. “My king was responsible for the\n",
            "death of my sister. She was all I had.\n",
            "“I know what it’s like to watch kin die,” he continued, in a voice that\n",
            "reminded her of the sea lapping the shore. Quiet, barely restrained in its\n",
            "resentment. “To be left adrift, a fraction of a whole. To be surrounded by\n",
            "others and no one, at once. We are the same, Arthie. We understand what\n",
            "it’s like to grieve with fire and not tears. What it’s like to do anything for\n",
            "those we love.”\n",
            "To grieve with fire. She did not grieve. Her family, childhood, life—\n",
            "they were gone. What point was there in grief?\n",
            "“But you have no one left.”\n",
            "He looked at her with a small, sad smile. “Is that not grief? The act of\n",

            "He slid the cuff up his forearm until it fit snug. “She was everything I\n",

            "I’ll never again have.”\n",
            "She had nearly lost Jin more than once, and then again just today. She\n",
            "had stood on the threshold of loss and stared it in the face, but could she\n",
            "have survived that fall?\n",
            "“She was a hashashin too,” he said, twirling a blossom between his\n",
            "fingers. It was too dark for Arthie to tell what it was and what significance\n",
            "it held. “And the reason I myself joined the creed. She excelled at\n",

            "He met her eyes. “Is there much of a difference?”\n",
            "She thought of the boats teetering on Ceylan’s shores, the blood that\n",
            "dyed her mother’s sari a deeper shade of red. She thought of the people who\n",
            "remained there now, foreigners in their own homes. No, Arthie decided,\n",
            "there wasn’t.\n",
            "“He vowed that Arawiya would not fall the way the rest of the world\n",
            "did,” Laith said, “and dispatched hashashin to retrieve hilya, artifacts that\n",
            "could be weaponized against us and used to challenge him. My sister’s\n",
            "talents caught the king’s interest, and he sent her here, to Ettenia. One girl,\n",
            "barely of age, out on a quest to save his kingdom.”\n",
            "Arthie didn’t share his sentiments. If she had been in that girl’s place,\n",

            "never been to sea. Most Arawiyans had not, but she caught sickness quickly.\n",

            "Laith turned the mug in his hands, swishing the remains of his coffee.\n",

            "for days departed.\n",
            "It seemed a wasteful way to live, burning fuel over something long\n",

            "She thought back to how strange it seemed that he was so loyal to\n",
            "Ettenia. How dedicated he was, to the point where it was obvious to her that\n",

            "Later still, it gave Arthie the courage to knock on Jin’s door. By the time she\n",
            "heard the soft laugh followed by his chuckle on the other side, it was too\n",
            "late. She’d already knocked. It was Laith’s fault for letting the ghosts in.\n",

            "He found her bashing the heads of two Plodders together, both far taller\n",
